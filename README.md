# Risky_Business
In this assignment we built a machine learning model to determine good/bad credit risk for the client using imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn liabraries and evaluated the models using Resampling and Ensemble Learning techniques

We found below findings from those techniques:

### Resampling:
1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

   Combination (Over and Under) Sampling near to 1

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    Combination (Over and Under) Sampling produced result near to 0.99. So it has the closest recall score

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    Combination (Over and Under) Sampling almost close to 1

### Ensemble Learning:
1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

    Easy Ensemble Classifier contain the best balanced accuracy score

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    both the model had same recall scoree

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    Easy Ensemble Classifier had the better geometric mean score tamong those two models

4. What are the top three features?

    total_rec_prncp, total_rec_int, last_pymnt_amnt had the top three features
